# C++ Modules (CPP00 - CPP04)

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by malhendi.*

---

## Description
This repository contains the C++ modules from **CPP00 to CPP04** at 42 Amman.

The goal of these modules is to transition from C to C++ and build a strong foundation in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using modern C++ standards (C++98).

Each module introduces core C++ concepts step by step, focusing on clean design, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management.

## Modules Overview

### CPP00 – Introduction to C++
- Namespaces
- Classes & Member Functions
- std::string
- I/O streams (std::cout, std::cin)
- Basic Makefile structure

### CPP01 – Memory & References
- Pointers vs References
- Dynamic memory allocation (new/delete)
- Constructors & Destructors
- File streams
- Basic class design

### CPP02 – Canonical Form & Orthodox Class
- Ad-hoc polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Copy constructor
- Copy assignment operator
- Rule of Three

### CPP03 – Inheritance
- Base & Derived classes
- Access specifiers (public, protected, private)
- Constructor/Destructor chaining
- Method overriding

### CPP04 – Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
- Subtype polymorphism
- Virtual functions
- Virtual destructors
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Deep vs Shallow copy

## Compilation

Each exercise contains its own Makefile.

To compile:
```bash
make
```

To clean:
```bash
make clean
```

To remove objects and binary:
```bash
make fclean
```

To recompile:
```bash
make re
```

Execution
After compilation, run:
```bash
./program_name
```

Replace program_name with the executable name defined in the Makefile.

Concepts Practiced
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Dynamic Memory Management
Rule of Three
Virtual Tables (vtable concept)
Clean class architecture
